  "1": "Before the phantom of False morning died, \nMethought a Voice within the Tavern cried, \n\"When all the Temple is prepared within, \nWhy nods the drowsy Worshipper outside?\" \n",
  "2": "And, as the Cock crew, those who stood before \nThe Tavern shouted--\"Open then the Door! \nYou know how little while we have to stay, \nAnd, once departed, may return no more.\" \n",
  "3": "Now the New Year reviving old Desires, \nThe thoughtful Soul to Solitude retires, \nWhere the White Hand Of Moses on the Bough \nPuts out, and Jesus from the Ground suspires. \n",
  "4": "Iram indeed is gone with all his Rose, \nAnd Jamshyd's Sev'n-ring'd Cup where no one knows; \nBut still a Ruby kindles in the Vine, \nAnd many a Garden by the Water blows, \n",
  "5": "And David's lips are lockt; but in divine \nHigh-piping Pehlevi, with \"Wine! Wine! Wine! \nRed Wine!\"--the Nightingale cries to the Rose \nThat sallow cheek of hers t' incarnadine. \n",

  "9": "Well, let it take them! What have we to do \nWith Kaikobad the Great, or Kaikhosru? \nLet Zal and Rustum bluster as they will, \nOr Hatim call to Supper--heed not you \n",

  "37": "And has not such a Story from of Old \nDown Man's successive generations roll'd \nOf such a clod of saturated Earth \nCast by the Maker into Human mould? \n",

  "39": "As then the Tulip for her morning sup \nOf Heav'nly Vintage from the soil looks up, \nDo you devoutly do the like, till Heav'n \nTo Earth invert you--like an empty Cup. \n",
  "40": "Perplext no more with Human or Divine, \nTo-morrow's tangle to the winds resign, \nAnd lose your fingers in the tresses of \nThe Cypress--slender Minister of Wine. \n",
  "41": "And if the Wine you drink, the Lip you press \nEnd in what All begins and ends in--Yes; \nThink then you are To-day what Yesterday \nYou were--To-morrow You shall not be less. \n",
  "42": "So when that Angel of the darker Drink \nAt last shall find you by the river-brink, \nAnd, offering his Cup, invite your Soul \nForth to your Lips to quaff--you shall not shrink. \n",
  "43": "Why, if the Soul can fling the Dust aside, \nAnd naked on the Air of Heaven ride, \nWere't not a Shame--were't not a Shame for him \nIn this clay carcase crippled to abide? \n",
  "44": "'Tis but a Tent where takes his one day's rest \nA Sultan to the realm of Death addrest; \nThe Sultan rises, and the dark Ferrash \nStrikes, and prepares it for another Guest. \n",
  "45": "And fear not lest Existence closing your \nAccount, and mine, should know the like no more; \nThe Eternal Saki from that Bowl has pour'd \nMillions of Bubbles like us, and will pour. \n",
  "46": "When You and I behind the Veil are past, \nOh, but the long, long while the World shall last, \nWhich of our Coming and Departure heeds \nAs the Sea's self should heed a pebble-cast. \n",
  "47": "A Moment's Halt--a momentary taste \nOf Being from the Well amid the Waste-- \nAnd Lo!--the phantom Caravan has reach'd \nThe Nothing it set out from--Oh, make haste! \n",
  "48": "Would you that spangle of Existence spend \nAbout the Secret--Quick about it, Friend! \nA Hair perhaps divides the False and True-- \nAnd upon what, prithee, may life depend? \n",
  "49": "A Hair perhaps divides the False and True; \nYes; and a single Alif were the clue-- \nCould you but find it--to the Treasure-house, \nAnd peradventure to The Master too; \n",
  "50": "Whose secret Presence, through Creation's veins \nRunning Quicksilver-like eludes your pains; \nTaking all shapes from Mah to Mahi; and \nThey change and perish all--but He remains; \n",
  "51": "A moment guess'd--then back behind the Fold \nImmerst of Darkness round the Drama roll'd \nWhich, for the Pastime of Eternity, \nHe doth Himself contrive, enact, behold. \n",
  "52": "But if in vain, down on the stubborn floor \nOf Earth, and up to Heav'n's unopening Door \nYou gaze To-day, while You are You--how then \nTo-morrow, You when shall be You no more? \n",
  "53": "Waste not your Hour, nor in the vain pursuit \nOf This and That endeavour and dispute; \nBetter be jocund with the fruitful Grape \nThan sadden after none, or bitter, Fruit. \n",
  "54": "You know, my Friends, with what a brave Carouse \nI made a Second Marriage in my house; \nDivorced old barren Reason from my Bed \nAnd took the Daughter of the Vine to Spouse. \n",
  "55": "For \"Is\" and \"Is-not\" though with Rule and Line \nAnd \"Up\" and \"Down\" by Logic I define, \nOf all that one should care to fathom, \nWas never deep in anything but--Wine. \n",
  "56": "Ah, but my Computations, People say, \nReduced the Year to better reckoning?--Nay \n'Twas only striking from the Calendar \nUnborn To-morrow, and dead Yesterday. \n",
  "57": "And lately, by the Tavern Door agape, \nCame shining through the Dusk an Angel Shape \nBearing a Vessel on his Shoulder; and \nHe bid me taste of it; and 'twas--the Grape! \n",
  "58": "The Grape that can with Logic absolute \nThe Two-and-Seventy jarring Sects confute: \nThe sovereign Alchemist that in a trice \nLife's leaden metal into Gold transmute: \n",
  "59": "The mighty Mahmud, Allah-breathing Lord \nThat all the misbelieving and black Horde \nOf Fears and Sorrows that infest the Soul \nScatters before him with his whirlwind Sword. \n",
  "60": "Why, be this Juice the growth of God, who dare \nBlaspheme the twisted tendril as a Snare? \nA Blessing, we should use it, should we not? \nAnd if a Curse--why, then, Who set it there? \n",
  "61": "I must abjure the Balm of Life, I must, \nScared by some After-reckoning ta'en on trust, \nOr lured with Hope of some Diviner Drink, \nTo fill the Cup--when crumbled into Dust! \n",
  "62": "Oh, threats of Hell and Hopes of Paradise! \nOne thing at least is certain--This Life flies; \nOne thing is certain and the rest is Lies; \nThe Flower that once has blown for ever dies. \n",
  "63": "Strange, is it not? that of the myriads who \nBefore us pass'd the door of Darkness through, \nNot one returns to tell us of the Road, \nWhich to discover we must travel too. \n",
  "64": "The Revelations of Devout and Learn'd \nWho rose before us, and as Prophets burn'd, \nAre all but Stories, which, awoke from Sleep, \nThey told their comrades, and to Sleep return'd. \n",
  "65": "I sent my Soul through the Invisible, \nSome letter of that After-life to spell: \nAnd by and by my Soul return'd to me, \nAnd answer'd \"I Myself am Heav'n and Hell:\" \n",
  "66": "Heav'n but the Vision of fulfill'd Desire, \nAnd Hell the Shadow from a Soul on fire, \nCast on the Darkness into which Ourselves, \nSo late emerged from, shall so soon expire. \n",
  "67": "We are no other than a moving row \nOf Magic Shadow-shapes that come and go \nRound with the Sun-illumined Lantern held \nIn Midnight by the Master of the Show; \n",
  "68": "But helpless Pieces of the Game He plays \nUpon this Chequer-board of Nights and Days; \nHither and thither moves, and checks, and slays, \nAnd one by one back in the Closet lays. \n",
  "69": "The Ball no question makes of Ayes and Noes, \nBut Here or There as strikes the Player goes; \nAnd He that toss'd you down into the Field, \nHe knows about it all--He knows--HE knows! \n",
  "70": "The Moving Finger writes; and, having writ, \nMoves on: nor all your Piety nor Wit \nShall lure it back to cancel half a Line, \nNor all your Tears wash out a Word of it. \n",
  "71": "And that inverted Bowl they call the Sky, \nWhereunder crawling coop'd we live and die, \nLift not your hands to It for help--for It \nAs impotently moves as you or I. \n",
  "72": "With Earth's first Clay They did the Last Man knead, \nAnd there of the Last Harvest sow'd the Seed: \nAnd the first Morning of Creation wrote \nWhat the Last Dawn of Reckoning shall read. \n",
  "73": "Yesterday This Day's Madness did prepare; \nTo-morrow's Silence, Triumph, or Despair: \nDrink! for you know not whence you came, nor why: \nDrink! for you know not why you go, nor where. \n",
  "74": "I tell you this--When, started from the Goal, \nOver the flaming shoulders of the Foal \nOf Heav'n Parwin and Mushtari they flung \nIn my predestined Plot of Dust and Soul. \n",
  "75": "The Vine had struck a fibre: which about \nIf clings my being--let the Dervish flout; \nOf my Base metal may be filed a Key, \nThat shall unlock the Door he howls without. \n",
  "76": "And this I know: whether the one True Light \nKindle to Love, or Wrath-consume me quite, \nOne Flash of It within the Tavern caught \nBetter than in the Temple lost outright. \n",
  "77": "What! out of senseless Nothing to provoke \nA conscious Something to resent the yoke \nOf unpermitted Pleasure, under pain \nOf Everlasting Penalties, if broke! \n",
  "78": "What! from his helpless Creature be repaid \nPure Gold for what he lent him dross-allay'd-- \nSue for a Debt he never did contract, \nAnd cannot answer--Oh, the sorry trade! \n",
  "79": "Oh, Thou, who didst with pitfall and with gin \nBeset the Road I was to wander in, \nThou wilt not with Predestined Evil round \nEnmesh, and then impute my Fall to Sin! \n",
  "80": "Oh, Thou who Man of baser Earth didst make, \nAnd ev'n with Paradise devise the Snake: \nFor all the Sin wherewith the Face of Man \nIs blacken'd--Man's forgiveness give--and take! \n",
  "81": "As under cover of departing Day \nSlunk hunger-stricken Ramazan away, \nOnce more within the Potter's house alone \nI stood, surrounded by the Shapes of Clay. \n",
  "82": "Shapes of all Sorts and Sizes, great and small, \nThat stood along the floor and by the wall; \nAnd some loquacious Vessels were; and some \nListen'd perhaps, but never talk'd at all. \n",
  "83": "Said one among them--\"Surely not in vain \nMy substance of the common Earth was ta'en \nAnd to this Figure moulded, to be broke, \nOr trampled back to shapeless Earth again.\" \n",
  "84": "Then said a Second--\"Ne'er a peevish Boy \nWould break the Bowl from which he drank in joy, \nAnd He that with his hand the Vessel made \nWill surely not in after Wrath destroy.\" \n",
  "85": "After a momentary silence spake \nSome Vessel of a more ungainly Make; \n\"They sneer at me for leaning all awry: \nWhat! did the Hand then of the Potter shake?\" \n",
  "86": "Whereat some one of the loquacious Lot-- \nI think a Sufi pipkin-waxing hot-- \n\"All this of Pot and Potter--Tell me then, \nWho is the Potter, pray, and who the Pot?\" \n",
  "87": "\"Why,\" said another, \"Some there are who tell \nOf one who threatens he will toss to Hell \nThe luckless Pots he marr'd in making--Pish! \nHe's a Good Fellow, and 'twill all be well.\" \n",
  "88": "\"Well,\" Murmur'd one, \"Let whoso make or buy, \nMy Clay with long Oblivion is gone dry: \nBut fill me with the old familiar juice, \nMethinks I might recover by and by.\" \n",
  "89": "So while the Vessels one by one were speaking, \nThe little Moon look'd in that all were seeking: \nAnd then they jogg'd each other, \"Brother! Brother! \nNow for the Porter's shoulder-knot a-creaking!\" \n",
  "90": "Ah, with the Grape my fading Life provide, \nAnd wash the Body whence the Life has died, \nAnd lay me, shrouded in the living Leaf, \nBy some not unfrequented Garden-side. \n",
  "91": "That ev'n my buried Ashes such a snare \nOf Vintage shall fling up into the Air \nAs not a True-believer passing by \nBut shall be overtaken unaware. \n",
  "92": "Indeed the Idols I have loved so long \nHave done my credit in this World much wrong: \nHave drown'd my Glory in a shallow Cup \nAnd sold my Reputation for a Song. \n",
  "93": "Indeed, indeed, Repentance of before \nI swore--but was I sober when I swore? \nAnd then and then came Spring, and Rose-in-hand \nMy thread-bare Penitence apieces tore. \n",
  "94": "And much as Wine has play'd the Infidel, \nAnd robb'd me of my Robe of Honour--Well, \nI wonder often what the Vintners buy \nOne half so precious as the stuff they sell. \n",
  "95": "Yet Ah, that Spring should vanish with the Rose! \nThat Youth's sweet-scented manuscript should close! \nThe Nightingale that in the branches sang, \nAh, whence, and whither flown again, who knows! \n",
  "96": "Would but the Desert of the Fountain yield \nOne glimpse--if dimly, yet indeed, reveal'd, \nTo which the fainting Traveller might spring, \nAs springs the trampled herbage of the field! \n",
  "97": "Would but some wing'ed Angel ere too late \nArrest the yet unfolded Roll of Fate, \nAnd make the stern Recorder otherwise \nEnregister, or quite obliterate! \n",
  "98": "Ah, Love! could you and I with Him conspire \nTo grasp this sorry Scheme of Things entire, \nWould not we shatter it to bits--and then \nRe-mould it nearer to the Heart's Desire! \n",
  "99": "Yon rising Moon that looks for us again-- \nHow oft hereafter will she wax and wane; \nHow oft hereafter rising look for us \nThrough this same Garden--and for one in vain! \n",
  "100": "And when like her, oh, Saki, you shall pass \nAmong the Guests Star-scatter'd on the Grass, \nAnd in your joyous errand reach the spot \nWhere I made One--turn down an empty Glass! \n"
